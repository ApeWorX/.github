## Our Projects

### Ape

[Ape Framework](https://apeworx.io/framework) is an easy-to-use Web3 development tool.
Users can compile, test, and interact with smart contracts all in one command line session.
With our [modular plugin system](https://docs.apeworx.io/ape/stable/userguides/quickstart.html#plugin-system),
Ape supports multiple smart contract languages, chains, developer tools/services, and more!

### Silverback

[Silverback](https://apeworx.io/silverback) lets you create and deploy your own Python bots that respond to on-chain events.
The Silverback library leverages Ape Framework as well as itâ€™s ecosystem of plugins and packages to enable you to develop
simple-yet-sophisticated automated applications that can listen and respond to live chain data in real time.
To get started developing with Silverback, check out our [Quickstart Userguide](https://docs.apeworx.io/silverback/stable/userguides/quickstart)
or visit [https://silverback.apeworx.io](https://silverback.apeworx.io) to sign up for the Silverback cloud-hosted application platform.

## Resources

Visit our [technical documentation hub](https://docs.apeworx.io) to get a deeper understanding of Ape, Silverback and our other OSS packages.

<!-- Read our [academic platform](https://academy.apeworx.io/) will help you master Ape Framework with tutorials and challenges. -->

## Contributing

To get started with working on our codebases, use the following steps to prepare your local environment:

```bash
# clone the GitHub repo and navigate into the folder
git clone https://github.com/ApeWorX/[project name].git
cd [project name]

# create and load a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# install the developer dependencies (-e is interactive mode)
pip install -e .'[dev]'
```

```{note}
You might run into issues where you have a local install and are trying to work with a plugin pinned to a specific version.
```

[The easiest solution](https://github.com/ApeWorX/ape/issues/90) to this is to fetch the tags via `git fetch upstream --tags` and reinstall via `pip install .`.
You will then have the correct version.

### Pre-Commit Hooks

We use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks to simplify linting and ensure consistent formatting among contributors.
Use of `pre-commit` is not a requirement, but is highly recommended.

Install `pre-commit` locally from the root folder:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Committing will now automatically run the local hooks and ensure that your commit passes all lint checks.

### GitHub Access Token

If you are a member of ApeWorX and would like to install private plugins,
[create a GitHub access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

Once you have your token, export it to your terminal session:

```bash
export GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

It is also useful to have this token for local development as some features of Ape communicate with GitHub, and may rate limit you otherwise without it.

### Displaying the Docs
First, make sure you have the docs-related tooling installed:

```bash
pip install -e .'[doc]'
```

Then, run the following from the root project directory:

```bash
python build_docs.py
```

For the best viewing experience, use a local server:

```bash
python -m http.server --directory "docs/_build/" --bind 127.0.0.1 1337
```

Then, open your browser to `127.0.0.1:1337` and click the `ape` directory link.

```{note}
Serving from `"docs/_build/"` rather than `"docs/_build/ape"` is necessary to make routing work.
```

### Submitting Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcomed! Please adhere to the following:

- Ensure your pull request passes our linting checks
- Include test cases for any new functionality
- Include any relevant documentation updates

It's a good idea to make pull requests early on.
A pull request represents the start of a discussion, and doesn't necessarily need to be the final, finished submission.

If you are opening a work-in-progress pull request to verify that it passes CI tests, please consider
[marking it as a draft](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests).
